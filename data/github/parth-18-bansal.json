And by this we can automatically label the PR if there is change in the src/type/** path and if in later commits the changes are removed then label get automatically removed using the \"sync-label\" attribute of it.\n\nTimeline: By End of the day.\n\nAdditional Context: https://github.com/actions/labeler"
