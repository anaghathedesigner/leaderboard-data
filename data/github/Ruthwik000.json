When facilities have 100+ locations, the map view only receives the current page's 12 locations instead of all available locations, causing most locations to be missing from the map display.\n\nApproach:\nSeparate Query for Map: Create a dedicated query for map view that fetches all locations without pagination limits\nIncrease Limit for Map: Use a much higher limit (e.g., 1000) or remove pagination entirely for map data\nConditional Fetching: Detect map view and modify query parameters to fetch complete dataset\nRemove Filtering: Disable mine: true, mode: kind filters that may exclude locations from map view\n\nETA: 1day"
