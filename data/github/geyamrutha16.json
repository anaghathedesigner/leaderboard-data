      "text": "@Jacobjeevan @rithviknishad , I'd love to take up this issue. I’ve already looked into the code and identified exactly where the change is needed — so I’m ready to go with a clear and consistent fix.\n\n**I noticed:**\n\n- The Date of Birth field lives inside the PatientRegistration component, rendered within the <TabsContent value=\"dob\"> block.\n- Even though it’s a required field (alongside Age as an alternative), the UI currently doesn’t show the * indicator, which might mislead users.\n\n**My Solution:**\n\n- Add a red asterisk (*) next to both the Date of Birth and Age labels using the same visual style (text-red-500) already used across the form.\n- Also update the tab labels (TabsTrigger) to reflect that both DOB and Age are required options (i.e., at least one must be filled).\n- Leave all existing validation logic as-is — the schema already handles the requirement correctly.\n\n<img width=\"400\" height=\"287\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1a35463-32b6-4257-b945-dd14b4241c64\" />\n\n**ETA:** I can raise a clean and tested PR within a few hours of assignment.\n\nCould you please assign this issue to me??"
