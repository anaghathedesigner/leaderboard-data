On clicking Save, it throws the validation error “Enter a file name.”\n- When closing the dialog via Cancel or the X icon, the error state is not cleared. Reopening the dialog still shows the previous error message.\n\nI’d like to address these , Can i fix it?"

      "text": "As mentioned earlier, the double-border issue was due to overlapping `outline` and `border` styles on focus. I've made the following changes to address this:\n\n### Change Made:\n- Disabled the default browser focus outline by adding `outline-none focus:outline-none`.\n- Ensured a consistent border style on focus using `focus-visible:ring-0` and `focus:border-primary-400` (for brand consistency).\n- Applied this fix in the `Input`.\n\nETA: 1 Day\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8c37456-afca-4e54-b845-09d2e8214f5c\n\nCan you please assign this issue to me?"
