The main changes in cleanup:\n\n1. **Reorganized code structure**: Moved `SimpleMedicationRequestSpec` to `request/spec.py` where it belongs\n2. **Improved imports**: Used local imports to prevent circular import issues  \n3. **Cleaner separation**: Each spec is now in its appropriate location with clear purpose\n\nThe circular reference issue is resolved while maintaining the bidirectional relationship between medications and prescriptions.

      "text": "\n> @copilot why don't we just remove medication_requests key when its inside a prescription object thats inside a medication request? \n\nGood catch! You're absolutely right. I've fixed the circular reference issue by creating a `SimpleMedicationRequestPrescriptionSpec` that excludes the `medication_requests` field when serializing prescriptions within medication request responses.\n\nThe issue was:\n- MedicationRequest → includes prescription (full object with medication_requests)\n- Prescription → includes medication_requests array\n- Each medication_request → would include prescription again...\n\nNow medication requests use the simple prescription spec (without medication_requests) while direct prescription API calls still include the full bidirectional relationship. This maintains the intended functionality while avoiding circular references.\n\nCommit: 230205d"

The fix I implemented addresses the `TypeError: 'mappingproxy' object cannot be converted to 'PyDict'` error in `EMRResource.to_json()` by replacing the problematic single-call approach with a two-step process that separates JSON mode conversion from field exclusion. The fix is minimal and preserves all functionality while resolving the error. Can you confirm if this is the correct approach or if there's a different aspect I should focus on?"
