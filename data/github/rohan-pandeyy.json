      "text": "Hi maintainers, I'd like to have a go at this issue, please assign to me if you find my approach viable\n\nI've gone through the backend to understand the 'Severity' field,\nSo this field is a string with three possible values: \"`mild`\", \"`moderate`\", and \"`severe`\". And it isn't a mandatory field (can be null) + there's no explicit default value.\nThe API field name is `severity`.\n\nHere's my described solution plan:\n1. define `severity` as union (\"mild\" | \"moderate\" | \"severe\" | null)\n2. Implement Severity Input as **dropdown (select component)**:\n   - Mild\n   - Moderate\n   - Severe\n   - None (since `severity` can be null)\n\n<img width=\"450\" height=\"251\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5483c867-f13c-4b21-a234-b486a12ff470\" />\n\n3. Display Severity in Questionnaire Responses and Patient Dashboard\n\n<img width=\"837\" height=\"149\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fa800b6-bf45-494b-8c3d-01f453f27cfd\" />\n\nExpected Timeline:\n- Day 1: Setting up input field, and API interactions to POST `severity` field.\n- Day 2: Setting up `severity` card and API interactions to GET `severity` field.\n- Day 3: Color coding, applying icons for easy recognition, styling and through testing.\n- End date: 3 days"
