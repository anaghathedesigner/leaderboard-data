I’ll verify each replacement by manually testing the component and reviewing how the date is handled internally.\n\nExpected Timeline:\nEnd date: July 5, 2025 (including testing and review buffer)\n\nPlease let me know if I can take this forward.

I’ll also add a quick test to cover this edge case and verify everything works in the UI.\n\nETA\nI plan to have a PR ready within 24 hours after being assigned the task to resolve this issue.\n\nThanks! 😊"
