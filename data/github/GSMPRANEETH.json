The `Actions` component is conditionally hidden when the current tab is the Notes tab. I will remove this condition so that `Actions` is rendered consistently across all tabs, including Notes.\n2. The Notes tab container is currently constrained with `max-w-5xl`, which limits its width unnecessarily.
