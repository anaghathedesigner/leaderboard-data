The problem is that `description` and `purpose` fields can be null in the database, but our validation schema doesn't handle null values. So i have fixed that as well.\n\nyou can close this one as completed.\n"

      "text": "> @Denyme24 , we can keep the alert logic to ValuesetSelectContent file only right ?\r\n\r\nwell @AdityaJ2305 i also thought about this before making the changes but,\r\nI think it makes more sense to keep the alert logic in the parent component, `ValueSetSelect`, rather than pushing it down into `ValueSetSearchContent`. That way, we stick to the single responsibility principle, `ValueSetSearchContent` can stay focused purely on handling the UI and search logic, without getting tied up in user actions or confirmation flows.\r\n\r\nThis also makes `ValueSetSearchContent` way more reusable, since it’s not carrying around any alert-specific logic that might not be needed in other contexts. All the confirmation handling stays in one place, the parent which keeps things cleaner and easier to manage. It’s a better separation of concerns: the child displays stuff, and the parent deals with what to do when users interact with it."
