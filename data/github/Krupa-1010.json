      "text": "@Tanuj1718 @Jacobjeevan I found that the root cause of this issue is not related to styling, but rather that the disabled state of the Save button never evaluates to true when the sheet opens. Currently, isLoadingTags is only true during tag setting or removing mutations, so the button isn’t disabled initially.\n\n<img width=\"672\" height=\"393\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b78d06f4-3919-4de0-9777-5c0f2fc147d9\" />\n\n<img width=\"776\" height=\"68\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/955cda64-55b8-4746-a676-62a5652eb500\" />\n\nShould I update the logic to disable the Save button when no tags are initially selected or when the selected tags are the same as the current tags (i.e., no changes made) ?"
